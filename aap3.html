                <p style="font-size: 20px;">**Tic Tac Toe** is a simple yet classic two-player game that is often played on a 3x3 grid. The
                    players take turns marking the spaces in the grid with their respective symbolsâ€”**X** and **O**. The
                    goal is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or
                    diagonally. Although the game appears straightforward, it involves a fair amount of strategy and
                    foresight. Tic Tac Toe is commonly used to teach the concepts of logic, strategy, and
                    problem-solving to beginners. Because of its simplicity, it's often one of the first games children
                    learn, and it's also a popular choice for digital implementation in programming projects and mobile
                    apps. Despite its small grid, the game offers valuable insights into competitive thinking and the
                    importance of anticipating your opponent's moves.
